<h1>How to create a GitHub Repostiory</h1>
<p>GitHub is a wonderful tool for beginner programmers to learn how to use. It allows for saving code to the cloud and continuous integration. In order to use GitHub developers commit, or add, changes to code in a shared repository, or folder. This allows teams to work together and resolve issues early in the development process.</p>
<h2>Create Repository</h2>
<p><strong>1. Open GitHub in a Browser</strong>
Pull up GitHub <a href="https://github.com/">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Login or Create Account</strong>
If you are creating an account, remember to save your password!</p>
<p><strong>3. Create a New Repo</strong>
